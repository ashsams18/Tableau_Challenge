**Visualisation 1** displays the 5 stations where journeys have started more than 30K times. 
**Visualisation 2** displays stations where journeys have ended more than 30K times. 
**It appears that stations such as '8th Avenue & W 31 St', 'Lafayette St & E 8 St' and 'E 17 St & Broadway' are popular start and end destinations.**
The **City official map** shows the **top 10 stations by 'Trip-duration Counts'**. (Legend shows station names). 
Information such as the above can aid the bike programme developers or city officials to provide more facilities at these busy stations; whether it is public toilet facilities, security cameras, guides or cafes.
**Visualisation 3,4 & 5** present a visual representation and breakdown of the trip-durations by the actual gender of users, the bikes used (by ids) and whether these users are riding on a 'pay as you go' basis or if they are subscribed customers, respectively.
The pie chart shows the sum of trips (in seconds) travelled by the bikes and segregated into males (1), females (2) and those who have not disclosed this information (0). 
The bar chart (Visualisation 4) presents a display of bikes that have been used for more than 1 million seconds (approx. 277 hours). **This information can help decide on how soon the bikes will need servicing and what are the most common parts that need adjusting. This information can aid in allocating the right funds towards this project.**
The bar chart (Visualisation 5) gives a breakdown of the trip-duration into customers who have subscriptions and those who don't. This chart also displays a representation of the type of bike users who have travelled the longest in duration; either paid subscribers or pay as you rides. The information is further broken down into genders. It is clear that the users who 'pay as they ride' do not tend to disclose their gender (unknown =0), which may be a requirement when setting up a paid subscription (male =1, female =2).
Again this information is vital in understanding how much money will be required for improvement or meeting user demands.
The above data should provide vital information on understanding who the primary bike users are. **The information presented here shows that the male bike user numbers are much greater than females.** 

**Visualisation 6,7 & 8** presents how the bike journeys have trended in New York. 
Visualisation 6 shows bike trip start times between Jan 2014 and June 2014. It appears that there is more activity between April and June, which could be related to the longer daylight periods, especially when daylight saving kicks in during March.

Visualisation 7 & 8 present bike journey start times for the 12th day in January and June respectively.

**The peak around 3pm to 5pm in January explains the school and work home times. There is less activity in the morning, which could be due to short days and darker mornings. 

The charts displaying start times by hours has also been separated by Gender. The chart trends are similar for male and female riders, however as there are more male bike users the trip data reflects this fact too.

In contrast, the chart for June shows peaks around 8am in the mornings which would relate to journey times to schools and work and the same around 5pm which would explain the same trips back home.**
